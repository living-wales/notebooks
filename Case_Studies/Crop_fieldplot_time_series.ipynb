    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how crops and their growth stages can be monitored, at parcel scale, in Near-Real Time using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensor, within the newly developed Wales Open Data Cube environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently Planet has started to provide daily satellite data to Wales, which could be very useful for crop monitoring. However, as any optical sensor, Planet imagery is impeded by cloud cover, as well as winter lack of illumination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Wales, the period of greatest cloud cover is from October to the end of April, which coincides with the beginning of the growing season for several crops. Moreover, cloud cover remains high during the whole year and as a consequence, through the major crop growth periods. In these conditions, even Planet, with its daily provision capacity, cannot provide near-real time data for monitoring crops during the whole growing season. \n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover or a lack of illumination and can acquire data over a site during day or night time under all weather conditions. Sentinel-1, with its C-SAR instrument, offers reliable repeated wide area monitoring with 10m spatial resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the new digital infrastructure (incl. Open Data Cube technology), as soon as new Sentinel-1 scenes are made available by Copernicus, data are processed to Analysis Ready Data format and made available on EODataDown and within the Wales Open Data Cube, thus allowing monitoring in Near-Real Time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the Near-Real Time Analysis Ready Sentinel-1 Data, as well as tools developed by Living Wales, to continuously monitor field plots and their states, incl. beginning of vegetation growth, key growth stages, harvest date.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Query a field plot of interest, by drawing it or selecting a field plot from a shapefile\n",
    "2. Loading data from datacube\n",
    "3. Masking data out of the field plot\n",
    "4. Tracking the evolution of a parcel in near-real time\n",
    "5. Study case: tracking the growth stages in a Rapeseed plot"
