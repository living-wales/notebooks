    "This notebook demonstrates how floods can be quickly mapped/monitored, using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensor, from the newly developped Wales Data Cube (`WDC`). \n",

    "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover or a lack of illumination and can acquire data over a site during day or night time under all weather conditions. Sentinel-1, with its C-SAR instrument, offers reliable repeated wide area monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Living Wales project has allowed generation of national annual land cover maps (2017-2021), but is also actively involved in the development of a new digital infrastructure (incl. Open Data Cube technology) for Wales that provides Analysis Ready Data, which are satellite data that have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with minimum additional user effort, and derived products in Near-Real Time.\n",
