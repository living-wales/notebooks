    "A \"datacube\" is a digital information architecture that specialises in hosting and cataloguing spatial information.\n",
    "The WDC is based on the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) infrastructure, and specialises in storing remotely sensed data, particularly from Earth Observation satellites such as [Sentinel-1](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/about-copernicus/infrastructure/discover-our-satellites) and [Sentinel-2](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/about-copernicus/infrastructure/discover-our-satellites).\n",
    "\n",
    "The WDC datacube will contains both Analysis Ready satellite Data and derivative data \"products\". Currently only Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data are available in the datacube, but all the environmental descriptors, and land cover and habitat maps will be indexed in WDC by March 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running a query to load data from the datacube, it is useful to know what it contains.\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates several straightforward ways to inspect the product and measurement contents of a datacube."
