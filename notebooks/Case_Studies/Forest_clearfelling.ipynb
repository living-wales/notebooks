    "### Clearfelling in Wales\n",
    "Wales is one of the least wooded countries in Europe, with woodland covering only 15% of the land area, compared to the European average of 38% (Welsh Government, 2018). In 2018, Welsh Government published the latest version of Woodlands for Wales.The 50-year strategy outlines Welsh Government’s vision and targets for Wales’ trees, woodlands and forest and aims to ensure high-quality woodlands that: \n",
    "- Enhance the landscape,\n",
    "- Are appropriate to local conditions,\n",
    "- Have a diverse mixture of species and habitats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017 (Natural Resources Wales, 2017), the vast majority of managed woodlands were reported as:\n",
    "- Planted single species, \n",
    "- Single aged (over half is coniferous),\n",
    "- Predominantly manged on clearfell & restock regime. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the diversity of woodlands, the range of silvicultural systems currently used by managers needs to widen.\n",
    "Typically, forests managed solely by a clearfell silvicultural system are characterised by poor structural diversity with uniform aged crops, limited or no diversity of structure within a stand and sometimes whole forest blocks using\n",
    "the same system. In contrast, forests managed using one or more of the range of Low Impact Silvicultural Systems (LISS) tend to be more structurally diverse, and therefore more resilient.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the objectives of the Woodlands for Wales strategy is to reduce the amount of clearfelling and increase the use of LISS. Therefore, monitoring clearfelling and condition of forests is important to show sucess of the Woodlands for Wales strategy."

    "## Description\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how the new Wales Open Data Cube (`WDC`) allows to quickly analyse multiple years of nearly daily Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, to monitor forest clearfelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "By comparison with optical sensors, that are mainly sensitive to colour and chemistry, SAR data are stronly correlated to height and texture. Moreover, SAR data have the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover, illumination or weather conditions, allowing to monitor forests during the whole year, including during winter period. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Living Wales project has faciliated the generation of national annual land cover maps (2017-2021), but is also actively involved in the development of a new digital infrastructure for Wales that provides Sentinel-1 data in an Analysis Ready Data (ARD) format. The data are processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with minimum additional user effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the Sentinel-1 Analyis Ready Data (ARD), as well as a customed python library, to map forest and clearfelling using algorithms developed through the Living Wales project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Querying data for an area and period of interest (i.e., 01 Jan 2017 - 12 Dec 2021)\n",
    "2. Loading data from datacube\n",
    "3. Mapping forest areas\n",
    "4. Mapping annual clearfells\n",
    "5. Mapping the extent and date of clearfells for the whole period\n",
    "6. Automatised reporting on clearfells for a period and area of interest\n",
