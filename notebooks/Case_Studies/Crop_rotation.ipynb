    "Crops are important in national and international economics, trade, and food security and are a major topic of interest in the domains of policy, economics, land management, and conservation. Monitoring agricultural practices is also essential as demand for food has placed huge pressures on landscapes and particularly natural ecosystems, with these impacting (often adversely) on soils, air, water, and biodiversity. By knowing and understanding the distributions, types, and management regimes (e.g., rotational cycles) of crops, changes in management practices can be better implemented to reduce pollution, conserve and/or restore biodiversity, and control the spread of crop diseases."

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how crop extent, rotation and dynamics can be quickly mapped/monitored over multiple years, using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensor, within the Wales Open Data Cube (`WDC`). \n",
    "\n",
    "By comparison with optical sensors, that are mainly sensitive to colour and chemistry, SAR data are stronly correlated to height and texture (i.e., the structure of crops). Moreover, SAR data have the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover, illumination or weather conditions, with this allowing monitoring of field plots over the course of the crop cycle including during winter period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the Sentinel-1 Analyis Ready Data (ARD), as well as custom python libraries for crop monitoring using algorithms developed by and provided through the Living Wales project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import an area of interest (e.g., a farm's field plots) from shapefile\n",
    "2. Reporting on the annual  crop type area\n",
    "3. Mapping crop rotation at farm scale\n",
