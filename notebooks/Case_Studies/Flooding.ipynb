    "## Description\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how floods can be rapidly mapped/monitored, using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensor through the framework of the newly developped Wales Data Cube (`WDC`). \n",
    "\n",
    "SAR is advantageous as it operates at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover or a lack of illumination and data can be acquired over a site during day or night time and under all weather conditions. Sentinel-1 SAR operates at C-band (approximately 6 cm wavelength) and offers reliable repeated wide area monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Living Wales project has faciliated the generation of national annual land cover maps (2017-2021), but is also actively involved in the development of a new digital infrastructure for Wales that provides Sentinel-1 data in an Analysis Ready Data (ARD) format.   These data allow observations of open water but also moisture in the environment, which can be used to map flood extent and dynamics.  The data are processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with minimum additional user effort.  Historical and Near-Real Time products relating to flooding can be generated and also summarised over varying time periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses historical and NRT Sentinel-1 data, as well as a customed python library, to map flooding using algorithms developed through the Living Wales project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Topics include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Querying data for an area and period of interest (i.e., 01 Feb - 15 Mar 2020)\n",
    "2. Loading data from datacube\n",
    "3. Mapping Sentinel-1 signal for each date of the period of interest\n",
    "4. Mapping flooded areas on daily basis\n",
